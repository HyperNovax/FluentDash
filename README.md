# FluentDash
I reinstalled Rainmeter a few weeks ago and I found an excellent skins for Windows 10.
So I corrected some things to make it work and I added some extra.

Thanks to [Mazeby](https://github.com/Mazeby/FluentDash) for the FluentDash !

The modifications that I made and that will make.
Widget concern all except music, weather, note and time skins.

- [X] Problem display measure GPU : GPU skin can collect measure when there is more that one graphics card.
- [X] Delete framerate indicator to GPU skin.
- [X] Replace speed fan GPU by GPU temperature.
- [ ] (**50%**) Create HDD skin. Skins for one hard disk and two hard drives. Create with variables, you can customize the size (like border).



- [ ] (**0%**) Adapt size of widgets (font size, border, size of circle) and add variables.
